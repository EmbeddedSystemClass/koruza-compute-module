# Koruza Compute Module board Manual

This document is dedicated to the Koruza CM board and all its features. 

## Introduction
Koruza CM board is the base board for the Raspberry Pi Compute Module CM1, CM3 and CM3Lite. The Raspberry Pi Compute Module (CM1), Compute Module 3 (CM3) and Compute Module 3 Lite
(CM3L) are DDR2-SODIMM-mechanically-compatible System on Modules (SoMs) containing processor, memory, eMMC Flash (for CM1 and CM3) and supporting power circuitry.

The CM1 contains a BCM2835 processor (as used on the original Raspberry Pi and Raspberry Pi B+ models), 512MByte LPDDR2 RAM and 4Gbytes eMMC Flash. The CM3 contains a BCM2837 processor (as used on the Raspberry Pi 3), 1Gbyte LPDDR2 RAM and 4Gbytes eMMC Flash. Finally the CM3L product is the same as CM3 except the eMMC Flash is not fitted, and the SD/eMMC interface pins are available for the user to connect their own SD/eMMC device.

Note that the BCM2837 processor is an evolution of the BCM2835 processor. The only real differences are that the BCM2837 can address more RAM (up to 1Gbyte) and the ARM CPU complex has been upgraded from a single core ARM11 in BCM2835 to a Quad core Cortex A53 with dedicated 512Kbyte L2 cache in BCM2837. All IO interfaces and peripherals stay the same and hence the two chips are largely software and hardware compatible.

All three versions of the Raspberry Pi compute module are supproted by the Koruza CM board.
